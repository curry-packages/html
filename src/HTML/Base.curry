--- Library for constructing static and dynamic HTML pages.
--- The [PADL 2001 paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45241-9_6)
--- contains a description of the basic ideas behind this library.
---
--- The installation of a cgi script written with this library
--- can be done by the command
---
---     curry makecgi -m initialForm -o /home/joe/public_html/prog.cgi prog
---
--- where `prog` is the name of the Curry program with
--- the cgi script, `/home/joe/public_html/prog.cgi` is
--- the desired location of the
--- compiled cgi script, and `initialForm` is the Curry expression
--- (of type IO HtmlForm) computing the HTML form (where `curry`
--- is the shell command calling the Curry system PAKCS or KiCS2).

--- The possible parameters of an HTML form.
--- The parameters of a cookie (FormCookie) are its name and value and
--- optional parameters (expiration date, domain, path (e.g., the path "/"
--- makes the cookie valid for all documents on the server), security) which
--- are collected in a list.
--- @cons FormCookie name value params - a cookie to be sent to the
---                                      client's browser
--- @cons FormCSS s - a URL for a CSS file for this form
--- @cons FormJScript s - a URL for a Javascript file for this form
--- @cons FormOnSubmit s - a JavaScript statement to be executed when the form
---                        is submitted (i.e., &lt;form ... onsubmit="s"&gt;)
--- @cons FormTarget s - a name of a target frame where the output of the
---                      script should be represented (should only be used
---                      for scripts running in a frame)
--- @cons FormEnc - the encoding scheme of this form
--- @cons FormMeta as - meta information (in form of attributes) for this form
--- @cons HeadInclude he - HTML expression to be included in form header
--- @cons MultipleHandlers - indicates that the event handlers of the form
---   can be multiply used (i.e., are not deleted if the form is submitted
---   so that they are still available when going back in the browser;
---   but then there is a higher risk that the web server process
---   might overflow with unused events); the default is a single use
---   of event handlers, i.e., one cannot use the back button in the
---   browser and submit the same form again (which is usually
---   a reasonable behavior to avoid double submissions of data).
